Here I created a subscription list for any newsletter or any business for contact with these subscribers using their names and email addresses. After filling out this sign-up form, send that data to a Mailchimp API server and, save that data in the audience list. After that process, we have our subscribers' data and we can send emails to our subscribers for information about newsletter articles or business.
